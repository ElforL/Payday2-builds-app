# Payday 2 Builds

An app to make and share payday2 skills builds.

In the building page, you can upgrade a skill by tapping it and downgrade it by holding.

The tree points calculations based on an unlocked tier 1 infamy sets which are:

unlocking the infamy tree, the assassin set, set of the ingenious, the slaughterhouse set, and the set of the corrupted

min infamy of 5

You can change the build name in the text field on the top of the build page.
You can import and export builds using the export/import string ( compatible with pd2skills.com ).

NOTE: This app is my first and I did it mainly to learn the Flutter framework, and now that I finished it I'm not going to be working on it as much, so you may find some bugs and problems if you do submit it in the issues section of this repo and I may fix it. or if you're a developer feel free to add your touch and send a pull request :)
